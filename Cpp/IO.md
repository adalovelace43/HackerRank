#Input and Output
This is a explanation of how the basic input and output operations work on HackerRank. There are two ways to read data from stdin (the input file).  
##cin and cout
If there are a list of values in the input statement such as 
`1
1245758
a`
namely an integer, a double and a character then the code to accept the input is to define respective variables and get each of them through a cin. 

##scanf 
Even though cin is recommended by many devlopers and programmers due to its simplicity, `scanf` is handy when you need to read many line of data and `printf` is used to output many lines of data. The covention to use cin is given here.
